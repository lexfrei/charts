# Example: Using extra volumes for separate incomplete downloads directory
#
# This example demonstrates how to mount a separate storage location for
# incomplete downloads. This is useful when you want to:
# - Keep incomplete files on faster/local storage (SSD)
# - Keep completed downloads on network storage (NFS/iSCSI)
# - Reduce wear on network storage from frequent writes
#
# IMPORTANT: After deploying, configure the incomplete directory path in
# Transmission's UI settings: Settings -> Torrents -> Incomplete Directory
# Set it to: /downloads/incomplete
#
# Or use environment variables to configure it automatically.
